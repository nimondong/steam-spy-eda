# 🎮 SteamSpy Exploratory Data Analysis 🎮

### 🚀 About

I’ve always been a pretty avid gamer (more into esports now-a-days). My EDA was focused on Steam game data sourced from Steam Spy. 

Steam Spy is Steam stats service based on Web API provided by Valve and gathers data from user profile. Steam is a popular online gaming platform. 

I looked at game variables such as Release Date, Price, Ratings, # of Owners, Total Playtime, Median Playtime, Developers, Genre, etc.
